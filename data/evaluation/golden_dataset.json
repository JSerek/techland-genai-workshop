The only logical thing to do is sleep.\n- Resources are too scarce, you have to loot every corpse and do Dark Zones on a regular basis to keep up.  I don't remember such issue in previous games.\n- Parkour is underwhelming, I remember it being better in old games.\n- Car driving and related mechanics also suck.\n- No ray tracing at time of writing this despite the promises (a month and a half after release).\n- No New Game+ at time of writing this despite the promises (a month and a half after release).\n- HDR sucks, it's overblown and loses details compared to SDR.

It makes no sense at all, and it not only breaks immersion but it's infuriating because it alerts the enemies in the entire area that close in on you in seconds.\r\n2)The combat is still shit, like DL2's. What made Techland think the DL2 combat system was ever good and decide to implement it into The Beast? DL1 had a much better combat system, with hits still landing even when the enemy dodges because they don't properly dodge, unlike DL2 and The Beast where I have to swing like a maniac to get a few good hits in, but they keep dodging and wasting my stamina and my weapon is dogshit so it won't hurt them.\r\n3) The skill tree is also bad, why is it so basic and not unique? Why can't I level up my one-handed or two-handed skills? Oh ya, that's because they don't exist and it doesn't matter which weapon you use because it doesn't matter, you can't main any weapon type because all that matters is the rarity of it and that makes using weapons feel like a hassle, because if I use a rare or lesser weapon, I can't kill enemies fast enough, I shouldn't have to look for epic weapons to be able to play the game properly.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot more issues, that I'm not surprised Techland never saw, because they don't test the game properly or have any actual consumer feedback.",

There are no small outposts with merchants on the level so if you want to stock up on resources you have to run or drive from 1 corner to another.\n\nThe map is a huge downgrade from DL1. The only major city has tall buildings which is not as fun to navigate as the 1 story Haran favellas. A good third of the map is an open field than you have to run through or drive if you are lucky to have a car nearby. The map is much smaller than DL1.\n\nFar less zombies than in DL1 and there are far fewer agressive runner zombies. The campaign is ok. Cringey James Bond-style villain and a few cool moments that set you the player on the road of revenge. But it felt like an extended tutorial that tries to slowly sell mechanics over each mission, rather than a story than integrates you into the world of the game.

I’ve been a huge Dying Light fan since the first game — and honestly, the first one was miles better than this and even the second one. You’d think by now they’d know exactly what makes this series special, but it feels like they didn’t put the same heart into it.\n\n\n\nThe ‘Beast’ transformation sounded like an epic feature, but it turned out to be a major disappointment — more of a gimmick than real gameplay. Going out at night? Completely pointless. Those monsters are absurdly strong even when you’re maxed out at level 15, and you can barely take one down without wasting everything you’ve got.\n\n\n\nI was hyped at the start, but the excitement died fast. It just feels like a missed opportunity. For a franchise this loved, we deserved better. They should’ve taken their time and made something truly amazing, not this half-finished experience.",

You have one \"City\" Part and that's it and houses are so spread out that you can't freely just jump around to avoid zombies, so you're better just running up the road to avoid them. \n\nThe combat is a Muh at best. the weapons just don't have a good feeling to them. I don't know if it's just me but it feels like every weapon i get has a sponge attached to end of it. \n\nIt's not a bad game, but it's not a great game. Whole game should just been a DLC at best.",

Only benefit is not having to run across open spaces, but rooftops are still best.\n\nCons:\n-Night is un-playable. The darkness is turned up to 12, so you cannot see anything at all without your light. Volatiles are literally everywhere and if you get more than 1-2 you cannot kill them before you die.\n-Parkour does not feel as smooth as DL2 (imo) and things that look grabable sometimes arent. Also the combat roll before hitting the ground works about 1/3rd of the time. Especially if you end up falling close to a wall.\n-Quests are far and few. I have gotten about 6 quests in the 7hrs of playtime. Not to mention the area levels which place barriers to how you can get around. \n-Hitting enemies is rough. If they get too close, you lose the animation and get grappled or hit. If you try to hit them from further back, they either dodge or it misses. \n\nTL:DR \nI really wanted to enjoy this game, but it just doesn't feel as good as DL2. Buy it on sale and try it out, but if you have DL2, I would play that instead.",

Kill one, turn around and another appears. Clear the area - o wait another literally materialises on screen. Then beside him another spawns. Volatiles running to where you are on the map even when you stand perfectly still then lurking and reuse to move out of their \"zone\" not scary, just annoying... How hard was it just to use the same setup from DL one and have another decent game? removing parkour stamina from a game that barely has room to freerun? errr yeah okay.\r\n\r\nLook I'm enjoying it now but it is in no way shape or form worth the asking price, They had a working recipe from DL1, broke that in DL2 and tried to redeem it in DL the beast but fell short and felt like alot of assets were removed prelaunch due to other bugs.

When DL2 released- it ran like crap, many glitches, and horrible balancing... buy hey! At least the gliding was cool! DLTB felt clunky and unbalanced like DL2. 99% of the parkour experienced in this game was just climbing rock walls. Aiming with guns is trash (so i only really used the shotgun which is great)... loot gained from side quests and darkzones made little impact on game play (leveling up was more so to keep up with the increasing difficulty of the game and no point did I ever feel... strong. Enemies take too many hits). Would have so much money and no idea what to spend it on, so I would just buy all ammo and crafting supplies from vendors. Skill points and Beast Mode are gimmicks, vs bosses they do very little and against a small group of zombies, you'll see yourself taking more damage than what you gain. There wasn't a single aspect to thing game that I felt it did well. I can rant more but I will stop here. Do yourself a favor and just play DL1, do the DLC, and then go to the community workshop and add mods.",

The parkour in this title is severely limited due to the map being mostly open fields, marsh, or open land. The story and side quests feel half as much as the previous titles, and even the map feels largely dull in comparison to the first game.\n\nThat being said, I still did have a moderate amount of fun in a playthrough but I found myself wanting it to end instead of seeking out easter eggs and challenges.",

Stamina system is garbage atleast at early levels(Had to download unlimited stamina mod to make the game playable) all the \"tougher\" zombies feel fucking awful to fight like not hard just not fun at all, I can do 3 actions on brutal before I have to retreat for 15-20seconds to continue meanwhile they are coded really annoying. When the game is more grounded it feels nice but there is alot of things that breaks that immersion and its not like they even trying to keep it grounded as you will notice with the story of the game. really regret spending the 60dollars on this game, did it to support techland but im struggling to play more than 1 hour here and there before I get bored, angry or annoyed. Wish it was more than it is, hire som good writers for the next game please.\n\nEDIT: I downloaded unlimited stamina mod and now the game feels better.",

The day night cycle is broken.  The climbing is slow, although it gets slightly better over time. But the biggest kick in the nuts is the grapple hook is COMPLETELY USELESS.  Might as well have left the grapple hook out of the game entirely.  When running and sometimes when in battle, basic zombies initiate the annoying grab animation WAY TO OFTEN.  A little is fine but if you ever get in a chase, you'll understand.\n\nThe melee weapons are severely underwhelming.  I was hoping they'd get better over time but it seems the enemies just scale with your level and therefore you have to go through the entire game using an entire stamina bar just to kill a basic zombie.  The boss fights are just a tedious battle of wack the boss until there dead with whatever melee weapon you have.  Guns and throwables do next to 0 damage on any boss.  \n\nThe story in itself isn't necessarily bad, but it isn't anything that keeps my attention, making me want to play more to find out what happens.  At this point I've turned the game to the easiest difficulty just to clear the story and never pick up again.\n\n If it weren't too late, I'd return the game and get my money back",
