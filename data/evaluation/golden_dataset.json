After the completion of The Beast and Dying Light 2 im left disappointed. The Dying Light games after the 1st fail to meet the charm of the original. The copy and paste of animations, Reskins of monsters/zombies, repeated environments. Missing Features and functions the original had in substitute for a subpar \"Beast Mode\". No functioning grapple, horrible vehicles, awful stamina system. This game left a lot to be desired.",

Running (more than a few times) from one side of the map, to the other side of the map. Yeah we have cars.

LAST GAME IM BUYING FROM THEM. ILL STICK TO THE ORIGINAL DYING LIGHT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THERE'S NO SEQUEL THAT'LL EVER GET CLOSE TO IT.

The controls are messy, the writing is subpar, and the combat feels worse then DL2. I'm not sure what you all are talking about. I wouldn't recommend this over DL2, and it's not nearly as good as DL1. I'd probably recommend this (barely), however I think it needs some negative scores to balance it out. Wait until it go's on sale if you're going to buy it, but it's meh at best.",

    "review_text": "The game is visually stunning with a 10/10 atmosphere beautiful lighting, great colors, clean design, and a strong contrast between tense, scary nights and relaxed daytime exploration. However, gameplay wise it quickly becomes mid. Enemies are repetitive and often just spammed everywhere, especially the annoying spitting enemy, and the Chimeras are pure copy-paste throughout the story, even being thrown at you in groups near the end just to fake difficulty. Quests are spread across the entire map, leading to constant running back and forth, while the car feels almost useless due to limited fuel and durability. Unlike Dying Light 1 and 2, there is no second map or new region, which makes the game feel even more repetitive. Despite being fun and well made overall, it feels like Dying Light 2 stripped down, as if you’re stuck playing only on the first map the entire time. Not worth $60 or even $47 on sale, even though you can still have a lot of fun with it.",
