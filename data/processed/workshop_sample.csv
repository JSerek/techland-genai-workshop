8,205105337,"I have played all the previous games and they have been great, however this one is very disappointing.

No fast travel and the grappling hook SUUUUCKS. The mods which require you to manually activate them are pretty dumb to. I have always played these games with two other friends and neither of them or I will ever use these mods.

The brutal difficulty is good but mainly it just draws out boss fights and makes them very tedious. When killing the bosses to become ""stronger"", it never felt like you were. When using best mode the damage felt the same especially against bosses.

There is also a extreme lack of skill points and most of the ""beast skills"" are pretty useless and really only apply to killing normal infected, as the skills used on bosses do less damage then using your weapons. 

Some pros are that the game looks really good and the weapons themselves are cool.

We have completed the majority of the game on brutal difficulty, but at this point with out fast travel and the tedious and pointless boss fights we may just turn down the difficulty to complete the game sooner. 

If we could we would refund if it was still possible.","gameplay,content,graphics,price"

Parkour is terrible. everything kills momentum.

21,208092593,"Overrated and a downgrade compared to previous games.

Pros:
- It's still a Dying Light game, if you liked the previous games you'll be OK with this one.

Neutral:
- Story.  Mid, I've seen worse.
- Side quests / activities.  Most are just busy work but I wouldn't complain.

Cons:
- No fast travel.  Wasting a half of my time to traverse the map isn't a gameplay, just artificial padding that doesn't value player's time.
- Zombie models are very limited, it's the same 6-7 clones everywhere.
- They made the nights practically unplayable in this sequel, there are volatiles everywhere.  The only logical thing to do is sleep.
- Resources are too scarce, you have to loot every corpse and do Dark Zones on a regular basis to keep up.  I don't remember such issue in previous games.
- Parkour is underwhelming, I remember it being better in old games.
- Car driving and related mechanics also suck.
- No ray tracing at time of writing this despite the promises (a month and a half after release).
- No New Game+ at time of writing this despite the promises (a month and a half after release).
- HDR sucks, it's overblown and loses details compared to SDR.  I had to use RenoDX mod to tone down the overblown mess.

22,205995099,"This game is alright, but there are major issues with the gameplay.
1)The stealth system is broken. Why do I get spotted in the dark by random person that's far away? It makes no sense at all, and it not only breaks immersion but it's infuriating because it alerts the enemies in the entire area that close in on you in seconds.
2)The combat is still shit, like DL2's. What made Techland think the DL2 combat system was ever good and decide to implement it into The Beast? DL1 had a much better combat system, with hits still landing even when the enemy dodges because they don't properly dodge, unlike DL2 and The Beast where I have to swing like a maniac to get a few good hits in, but they keep dodging and wasting my stamina and my weapon is dogshit so it won't hurt them.
3) The skill tree is also bad, why is it so basic and not unique? Why can't I level up my one-handed or two-handed skills? Oh ya, that's because they don't exist and it doesn't matter which weapon you use because it doesn't matter, you can't main any weapon type because all that matters is the rarity of it and that makes using weapons feel like a hassle, because if I use a rare or lesser weapon, I can't kill enemies fast enough, I shouldn't have to look for epic weapons to be able to play the game properly.

24,212174392,"This was a good course correction after laughable Dying Light 2 story. But when it comes to the gameplay, at least 1/3 of the game I was [u]wasting[/u] on traversing from one corner of the map to another between missions. There are no small outposts with merchants on the level so if you want to stock up on resources you have to run or drive from 1 corner to another.

The map is a huge downgrade from DL1. The only major city has tall buildings which is not as fun to navigate as the 1 story Haran favellas. A good third of the map is an open field than you have to run through or drive if you are lucky to have a car nearby. The map is much smaller than DL1.

Far less zombies than in DL1 and there are far fewer agressive runner zombies. The campaign is ok. Cringey James Bond-style villain and a few cool moments that set you the player on the road of revenge. But it felt like an extended tutorial that tries to slowly sell mechanics over each mission, rather than a story than integrates you into the world of the game. I don't remember DL1 campaign to be that tacked on. Oh and it's quite short too.

28,214358109,"BUGGY VOICES / HEARING OTHER PEOPLE'S GAME??!!

I've been a huge fan of this franchise since it was first released, so as you can image I was hyped for Kyle's return. 
That being said I played this on release and found almost every time I played a mission that was indoors I could hear strange sounds almost like I could hear somebody else's mic? Except I keep my sessions private and voice chat off? 
It was borderline tolerable for a while until at one point I literally started hearing someone's baby crying (Loudly).
As well as being able to hear dialogue from somebody else's session which not only is really strange but also huge spoilers. From keyboard noises to voices then whole family shenanigans through the game audio made me think I was going crazy. 
I left the game a while to hope it got fixed at some point but after coming back today I'm pretty bummed to see it hasn't and the issue seems to be something ongoing since early Dying Light 2.

I'm not sure how it is even possible to be hearing other people's in game audio and mics but it's enough to make me not want to play the game as it completely ruins the immersion of what I can imagine would be a fantastic game. 

Hopefully this gets fixed soon.","bugs,story,audio"
29,205371534,"Has the worst city traversal in the series, its literally better to just get the dash skill and run everywhere because the trucks are more fragile than you and the actual parkour sucks. Wanna make a jump from one level of the city to another? Well you a very specific building that the one your on doesnt path to it so you either backtrack for a minute or spend the minute climbing up from ground floor.

Using your bare hands is significantly more effective than any other weapon unless you are overleveled for an area. It seemingly always takes 5-6 punches to kill a zombie in an area of equal level, and almost always 5 hits with any weapon despite the damage numbers sometimes more, but your fists generate more of your Beast Mode bar with each hit by a significant amount.

Speaking of Beast Mode, its great and i love it but building the bar is so fucking stupid. I build the bar up right before the Mist chimera fight, but logged off as it was already late. When i logged back in in i had no bar. You lose your bar on quitting to the main menu, dying, and resting.

The ‘Beast’ transformation sounded like an epic feature, but it turned out to be a major disappointment — more of a gimmick than real gameplay. Going out at night? Completely pointless. Those monsters are absurdly strong even when you’re maxed out at level 15, and you can barely take one down without wasting everything you’ve got.

Pros:
-Gore is maxed. you can literally split a head open and see the brain.
-Beast mechanic is interesting as a new concept

Misc: 
-Driving cars, which I think is new, but honestly isnt super enjoyable. Only benefit is not having to run across open spaces, but rooftops are still best.

Cons:
-Night is un-playable. The darkness is turned up to 12, so you cannot see anything at all without your light. Volatiles are literally everywhere and if you get more than 1-2 you cannot kill them before you die.
-Parkour does not feel as smooth as DL2 (imo) and things that look grabable sometimes arent. Also the combat roll before hitting the ground works about 1/3rd of the time. Especially if you end up falling close to a wall.
-Quests are far and few. I have gotten about 6 quests in the 7hrs of playtime. Not to mention the area levels which place barriers to how you can get around. 
-Hitting enemies is rough. If they get too close, you lose the animation and get grappled or hit. If you try to hit them from further back, they either dodge or it misses.

The melee weapons are severely underwhelming.
