Forced hold-to-interact on the same button as hold-to-heal, so you use a healing item by accident half the time you're looting the dozens of zombie corpses which you must do one by one. Constantly getting stuck on invisible edges while moving, leading to getting grabbed for another forced 3 second QTE for the 50000 time. Don't worry though, once you break out of it another zombie will slide across the room to grab you again.

However, gameplay wise it quickly becomes mid. Enemies are repetitive and often just spammed everywhere, especially the annoying spitting enemy, and the Chimeras are pure copy-paste throughout the story, even being thrown at you in groups near the end just to fake difficulty. Quests are spread across the entire map, leading to constant running back and forth, while the car feels almost useless due to limited fuel and durability. Unlike Dying Light 1 and 2, there is no second map or new region, which makes the game feel even more repetitive. Despite being fun and well made overall, it feels like Dying Light 2 stripped down, as if you’re stuck playing only on the first map the entire time.

performance is worse than dying light 2. how they managed this ill never know. i get more stable frames in BL4.

gameplay wise it is great, but when you hit a zee and the game drops 50fps... should have set my expectations far lower for techland.

wait till its on sale, game is NOT worth the price tag.",english,2025-09-19T02:18:51,negative,False,3,0,1.4,85,True,True,False,310.0
